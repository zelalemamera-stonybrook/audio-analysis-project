# the following shell script automates and implements the entire data pipeline.
# there are environmental variables and applications that are assumed to exist on the machine before running this script
# PRAAT should be set to the application location to praat. conda should be installed and have an aligner environment available for mfa. Please look at the set up
# instructions for mfa for how to add this specfically from https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

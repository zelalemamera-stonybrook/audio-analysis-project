'''
The following program prepares audio files for forced alignment. This is the first step of the data processing pipeline that feeds into the StressClassifier neural network.
After this program runs, the relelant audio and text directories have been generated for the alignment.
We use montreal forced aligner to obtain the aligned corpus and proceed to the next step of the pipeline.
The user is ultimately expected to generate the appropriate syllabifications via the Praat software. All of the data necessary to do this will be generated.
